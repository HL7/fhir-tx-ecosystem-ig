### R4 and the Test Cases

The test cases are expressed in R5, but are intended to test 
R4 servers as well (in fact, most servers that are tested are 
R4 servers).

How R4 testing works is that the Test Case runner that runs
when the validator runs the test cases looks at the server 
capability statement, and sees that it's an R4 server (based on
CapabiltityStatement.fhirVersion), and then converts all the 
requests amd responses between R5 and R4 on the fly. 

The /tests directory contains a /test/r4 subdirectory that 
contains a copy of all the requests converted to R4 to help
with understanding the conversion process. Unfortunately, 
because the responses are not valid resources, there's no 
similar conversion process. 

This documentation has to suffice. 

#### Properties in Expansions

The main difference is around ValueSet.expansion.property and 
ValueSet.expansion.contains.property. The Test Case runner 
uses cross-version extensions for these in R4. Here's an example
in R5 for a response with properties:

```json  
  "expansion" : {
    "property" : [{
      "code" : "definition",
      "uri" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#definition"
    }],
  }
  ```

  Note: some JSON properties have been omitted.

  Here's the same definition in R4:

```json
  "expansion" : {
    "extension" : [{
      "extension" : [{
        "url" : "uri",
        "valueUri" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#definition"
      },
      {
        "url" : "code",
        "valueCode" : "definition"
      }],
      "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ValueSet.expansion.property"
    }]
  }
```

Properties on contained entries are similar. R5:
```json
  "contains" : [{
    "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/test/CodeSystem/simple",
    "code" : "code1",
    "display" : "Display 1",
    "designation" : [{
      "use" : {
        "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/test/CodeSystem/designations",
        "code" : "olde-english"
      },
      "value" : "mine own first code"
    }],
    "property" : [{
      "code" : "definition",
      "valueString" : "My first code"
    }]
  }]
```

and in R4:

```json
  "contains" : [{
    "extension" : [{
      "extension" : [{
        "url" : "code",
        "valueCode" : "definition"
      },
      {
        "url" : "value",
        "valueString" : "My first code"
      }],
      "url" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ValueSet.expansion.contains.property"
    }],
    "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/test/CodeSystem/simple",
    "code" : "code1",
    "display" : "Display 1",
    "designation" : [{
      "use" : {
        "system" : "http://hl7.org/fhir/test/CodeSystem/designations",
        "code" : "olde-english"
      },
      "value" : "mine own first code"
    }]
  }]
```
