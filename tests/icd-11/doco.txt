- validate against value set 
  - known value set good
  - known value set bad code

  - only base codes 
  - on postCoordination axes (exists and value)
  - classKind (and add to look up)

- check version needed is true


- expand
  - known value set + adhoc variants 

  - adhoc value sets as above
